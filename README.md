# MatrixURL Project by Ryota Mine

After Web Development Bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs, I wanted to create a Ruby on Rails version of [TinyApp](https://github.com/ryotamine/tinyapp). I did so by having a theme from the movie ["The Matrix"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix). MatrixURL is a Matrix-themed full-stack web application built with Ruby on Rails 5.2 that allows users to shorten long URLs.
